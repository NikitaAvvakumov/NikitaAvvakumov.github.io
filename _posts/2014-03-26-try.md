This Ruby method returns nil rather than raising an exception when called on a non-existent object.

{% highlight bash %}
$ rails console
2.1.0 :001 > nil.admin?
NoMethodError: undefined method 'admin?' for nil:NilClass
... stack trace ...
2.1.0 :002 > nil.try(:admin)
 => nil
{% endhighlight %}

Here's a practical example: Is the currently signed in user an admin? If so, he should see site admin links, otherwise they should be hidden:

**any_view_file.html.erb:**
{% highlight erb %}
<% if current_user.admin? %>
  Show links
<% end %>
{% endhighlight %}

The above code breaks when the page is viewed by a non-signed-in visitor and `current_user` is not set (i.e. is nil).

The `if` statement can be augmented to include two tests:
{% highlight erb %}
<% if current_user && current_user.admin? %>
  Show links
<% end %>
{% endhighlight %}

Or the `try` method can be used to clean up the code:
{% highlight erb %}
<% if current_user.try(:admin) %>
  Show links
<% end %>
{% endhighlight %}

The `if` statement will return `true` if the currently signed in user is an admin, `false` if he is not, and `nil` if there is no signed in user. Since `nil` is falsey, the admin links remain nicely hidden.

(This approach merely cleans up the layout for unauthorized users. It should not be relied on to actually prevent unauthorized access to controller actions.)
